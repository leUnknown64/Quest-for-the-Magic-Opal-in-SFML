# Quest-for-the-Magic-Opal-in-SFML

Quest for the Magic Opal is a game I created for my final project in the class "Imaginary Friends in Fiction."
I wrote the game in C++ and used the graphics library SFML.
The source code, game resources, and Windows executable are provided.

Note: You must have the SFML libraries installed on a Windows machine to run the executable.
